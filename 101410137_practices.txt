1. **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks such as testing, deployment, and infrastructure provisioning to save time and reduce errors.
2. **Collaboration**: Encourage open communication between development and operations teams to streamline processes and align goals.
3. **Continuous Testing**: Implement automated tests throughout the development cycle to catch bugs early and ensure the quality of the code.
4. **Version Control**: Use Git or similar version control systems to track changes in code and configurations, enabling easy rollbacks if needed.
5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement monitoring and logging tools to track performance and detect issues in real time, ensuring quick responses to potential problems.
6. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Manage and provision infrastructure using code, enabling consistent environments and reducing manual configuration errors.

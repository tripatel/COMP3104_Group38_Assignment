Cloud computing plays a crucial role in DevOps by providing scalable infrastructure that supports rapid development and deployment processes. Cloud platforms like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud offer flexible, on-demand resources that are ideal for automating CI/CD pipelines, testing, and application hosting. Cloud environments also enable teams to quickly provision servers and infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC), allowing for repeatable, consistent setups across development, staging, and production environments. This flexibility and scalability are key to accelerating software delivery and improving collaboration in a DevOps workflow.

Learning DevOps is essential in modern software development due to its role in bridging the gap between development and operations teams. DevOps practices improve collaboration, reduce manual processes, and increase the speed of delivery while maintaining high quality. In the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), DevOps allows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), ensuring that software can be released faster and more reliably. It also helps in automating repetitive tasks such as testing and deployment, which improves efficiency and reduces human errors, enhancing overall productivity.

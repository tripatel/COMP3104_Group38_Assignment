Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are key practices in DevOps. CI involves automatically integrating code changes into a shared repository multiple times a day. Each change is automatically tested, allowing teams to detect and fix issues early. Continuous Deployment (CD) extends CI by automating the release of these changes to production. This approach minimizes manual intervention, reduces time to market, and allows for frequent, reliable updates to software products. Together, CI/CD creates a streamlined process for software development, ensuring rapid and stable deployment.
